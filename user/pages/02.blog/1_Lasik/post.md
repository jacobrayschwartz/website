So I had Lasik yesterday.

And I can say, it was fantastic! The day after I've got 20/15 vision. Almost all of the discomfort is gone and I can see better than I did before with my contacts. 

I think that everyone should do research before getting surgury, **especially elective surgery**, but in the long run, I think it's worth it. 

Though, these last few days have been a bit of a rollercoaster. My father had a gamma knife procedure to erradicate cancer growing behind his eye. This was the beginning of a period of constant pain for him, which would last over a decade, until he passed away. I felt both excited to be able to see on my own without corrective lenses, and afraid that something would go wrong and I'd live with constant pain. 

Expectedly, thankfully, the surgery went flawlessly. I'm thankfull for the blessing that I have to be able to undergo this procedure. I can see well and just a day after the surgery I have very little discomfort. 

> Thank You, God, that I was able to go through this. Thank You that I had the spare resouces for the operation. Thank You that I am healing well.
