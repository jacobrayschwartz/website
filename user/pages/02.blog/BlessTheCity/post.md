## A Grave Concern

Often times, I hear Christians worry or complain that we live in a post-Christian world. What people usually mean by this, is that for a time, the world (and in most cases, the "world" they refer to is the United States) was largely full of people who would call themselves Christians, but now that time has passed. The world is now full of people who do not know Christ, and seem to be very happy with that new status quo. 

There are a number of issues with this statement. For instance, the claim that America is post-Christian, is a little dubious. Many evangelicals will count the Founding Fathers among the faithful without a second thought. There is a great deal of discension over this idea. While the Fathers were of Protestant groups, there is a good deal of evidence to suggest they would not be recognized as practicing Christians in today's world. Deism, that unorthodox religious practice that proposes God has had no interaction in His creation since it began[1], was sweeping through western thought and certainly had influence in the Founding Fathers[2]. The Huffington Post has a long article making further points on the matter, regarding the Constitution and other founding documents of the United States[3], though some of their arguments are disputed. 

But my main issue with the complaint, and the point of this article, is not to make a case on whether or not we were a Christian nation. In fact, I think we must look beyond this. That is, **it does not matter if we were once a Christian nation or world**. Ideas and conjecture on this point are interesting, well and good. But arguments on the point serve little more than to gain the feeling that one is "right" and keeps us stuck in the past. This is deeply distressing as it causes the focus of sharing the Gospel to shift from the world's need of the Savior to my own ego. So, *stop it*. You'll get nowhere, you will not win anyone over with your arguments. It is time to ask the question: "Do I want to show the world who Christ is and our need of Him, or do I want to show the world that I am right?" Motive is everything. 

## Getting to the Point
What, then, should we be concerned with? Simple, our mission is unchanged from the beginning:

> Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
>
> *Matthew 28:19*

How do we do that in this modern world, which seems to have no care of its need of Christ the Savior? Luckily, there are examples from the Bible, which we can apply to our current predicament. 

You see, Israel was no stranger to being surounded by peoples who not only didn't have faith in God, but who were actively against such an idea. Israel was sieged, many of her people killed and then those still alive were carried off away from their Promised Land. The people of this new nation, who practiced the Ancient Mesopotamian religion, served gods and ideals that were wholy against our God. 

It is here where we find an important command. The prophet Jeremiah wrote to those who had been exiled to Babylon:

> This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the captives he has exiled to Babylon from Jerusalem: “Build homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens, and eat the food they produce. Marry and have children. Then find spouses for them so that you may have many grandchildren. Multiply! Do not dwindle away! **And work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, for its welfare will determine your welfare.**”
> 
> *Jeremiah 29:4-7* - Emphasis added
