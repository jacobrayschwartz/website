Often times, I hear Christians worry or complain that we live in a post-Christian world. What people usually mean by this, is that for a time, the world (and in most cases, the "world" they refer to is the United States) was largely full of people who would call themselves Christians, but now that time has passed. The world is now full of people who do not know Christ, and seem to be very happy with that new status quo. 

There are a number of issues with this statement. For instance, the claim that America is post-Christian, is a little dubious. Many evangelicals will count the Founding Fathers among the faithful without a second thought. There is a great deal of discension over this idea. While the Fathers were of Protestant groups, there is a good deal of evidence to suggest they would not be recognized as practicing Christians in today's world. Deism, that unorthodox religious practice that proposes God has had no interaction in His creation since it began[1], was sweeping through western thought and certainly had influence in the Founding Fathers[2]. The Huffington Post has a long article making further points on the matter, regarding the Constitution and other founding documents of the United States[3], though some of their arguments are disputed. 

But my main issue with the complaint, and the point of this article, is not to make a case on whether or not we were a Christian nation. In fact, I think we must look beyond this. That is, **it does not matter if we were once a Christian nation or world**. Ideas and conjecture on this point are interesting, well and good. But arguments on the point serve little more than to gain the feeling that one is "right" and keeps us stuck in the past. This is deeply distressing as it causes the focus of sharing the Gospel to shift from the world's need of the Savior to my own ego. So, *stop it*. You'll get nowhere, you will not win anyone over with your arguments. It is time to ask the question: "Do I want to show the world who Christ is and our need of Him, or do I want to show the world that I am right?" Motive is everything. 

## Getting to the Point
What, then, should we be concerned with? Simple, our mission is unchanged from the beginning:

> Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
>
> *Matthew 28:19*

How do we do that in this modern world, which seems to have no care of its need of Christ the Savior? Luckily, there are examples from the Bible, which we can apply to our current predicament. 

## Ancient Israel in Exile

You see, Israel was no stranger to being surounded by peoples who not only didn't have faith in God, but who were actively against such an idea. Israel was sieged, many of her people killed and then those still alive were carried off away from their Promised Land. The people of this new nation, who practiced the Ancient Mesopotamian religion, served gods and ideals that were wholy against our God. 

It is here where we find an important command. The prophet Jeremiah wrote to those who had been exiled to Babylon:

> This is what the Lord of Heaven’s Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the captives he has exiled to Babylon from Jerusalem: “Build homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens, and eat the food they produce. Marry and have children. Then find spouses for them so that you may have many grandchildren. Multiply! Do not dwindle away! **And work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, for its welfare will determine your welfare.**”
> 
> *Jeremiah 29:4-7* - Emphasis added

So, God commanded the exiles to put down roots, to multiply even. In a land of the people who had dragged them from their homes, killed their families and were wholy against our God, the captive Israelites were told to work for peace and prosperity, to bless the city they were taken to. 

## Under Roman Rule, Examples Set By Christ And the Early Church

Let us take this to the New Testement. In the time when Christ walked amoung us and for years after, Israel was under Roman rule. Once again, the Hebrews were subjugated. These Romans had conquered Jeruselem in 63 BC. Again, Israel lived under the reign of heathens, worshiping a pantheon of idols. Herod the Great presided as a king over Judea, and at the time of Jesus' birth, ordered the slaughter of all the boys, two years old and under in Bethlehem [4][5].

But what do we see of Christ's earthly life in this time? Did He rise up and take back the land from these heathens? Did He organize some political majority to make Judea great again? Did He form an armed malitia to take power from the government and give it back to the people?

For the record, no, He did not. And neither did the early church. 

The entire New Testement took place while the Romans were in power. And yet Christ rarely made any statements concerning these rulers. When he did, it was hardly what the people at the time would have expected. In fact, in a time where Rome was exacting heavy taxes on the people, along with tax collectors gathering their cut, He told the people to pay their taxes[6]. When Jesus was set before Pilate, by the religeous leaders of the day, we again see what would have been a peculiar response:

> So Pilate said to him, “You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?” Jesus answered him, “**You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore he who delivered me over to you has the greater sin.**” 
>
> John 19:10-11 - Emphasis Added

What's more, in Paul's letters, we see again that we are to even submit to these authorities[7] and to pray for them[8]. When was the last time we prayed for our leaders, when we felt like they were against us? And no, impecatory prayers do not count.

But I don't want this to become a post about the role of Christians in politics. That's for another article.

Let me end the section with a poiniant quote from Christ:

> “You have heard the law that says, ‘Love your neighbor’ and hate your enemy. But I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you! In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike. If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much.
